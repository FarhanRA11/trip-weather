        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Input</h3>
                <p>User will input latitude and longitude on starting and destination point, departure time is also required</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>Inputted data will be put together and send to URL parameters. Then, those data will computed through 3 main function (Routing, Address Finding, and Weather Forecast).<br><br>
                
                - First functoin will find the route between 2 points to determine the waypoint and estimated time.<br>
                - Second function will check all the waypoints to find the address.<br>
                - Third function will check all the waypoints to forecast weather based from the time at that waypoint.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Output</h3>
                <p>All of those data (route, address, estimated time, weather forecast) will showed at each waypoints on the map if user clicked it, while detailed data will showed below the map</p>
            </li>
